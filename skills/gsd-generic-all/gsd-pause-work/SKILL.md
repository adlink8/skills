description: [通用版] "Create context handoff when pausing work mid-phase"
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Bash
---


<objective>
Create `.continue-here.md` handoff file to preserve complete work state across sessions.

Routes to the pause-work workflow which handles:
- Current phase detection from recent files
- Complete state gathering (position, completed work, remaining work, decisions, blockers)
- Handoff file creation with all context sections
- Git commit as WIP
- Resume instructions
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.planning/workflows/pause-work.md
</execution_context>

<context>
State and phase progress are gathered in-workflow with targeted reads.
</context>

<process>
**Follow the pause-work workflow** from `@.planning/workflows/pause-work.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Phase directory detection
2. State gathering with user clarifications
3. Handoff file writing with timestamp
4. Git commit
5. Confirmation with resume instructions
</process>

<generic_adapter>
This is a GENERIC version of the GSD skill. It works with any AI runtime
(WorkBuddy, Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, etc.).

To use this skill with the generic GSD SDK:
  1. Ensure the generic `gsd-sdk-gen` and `gsd-tools-gen` are on your PATH:
     export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/gsd-generic-all/bin"
  2. The SDK will auto-detect the .planning/ directory in your project root.
  3. All `gsd-sdk-gen query` and `gsd-tools-gen.cjs` calls in this skill work unchanged.

Original Codex-specific paths have been replaced with relative .planning/ paths.
