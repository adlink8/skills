<context>
**Flags:**
- `--name` (required) — Workspace name
- `--repos` — Comma-separated repo paths or names. If omitted, interactive selection from child git repos in cwd
- `--path` — Target directory. Defaults to `~/gsd-workspaces/<name>`
- `--strategy` — `worktree` (default, lightweight) or `clone` (fully independent)
- `--branch` — Branch to checkout. Defaults to `workspace/<name>`
- `--auto` — Skip interactive questions, use defaults
</context>

<objective>
Create a physical workspace directory containing copies of specified git repos (as worktrees or clones) with an independent `.planning/` directory for isolated GSD sessions.

**Use cases:**
- Multi-repo orchestration: work on a subset of repos in parallel with isolated GSD state
- Feature branch isolation: create a worktree of the current repo with its own `.planning/`

**Creates:**
- `<path>/WORKSPACE.md` — workspace manifest
- `<path>/.planning/` — independent planning directory
- `<path>/<repo>/` — git worktree or clone for each specified repo

**After this command:** `cd` into the workspace and run `/gsd-new-project` to initialize GSD.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.planning/workflows/new-workspace.md
@.planning/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<process>
Execute the new-workspace workflow from @.planning/workflows/new-workspace.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (validation, approvals, commits, routing).

<generic_adapter>
This is a GENERIC version of the GSD skill. It works with any AI runtime
(WorkBuddy, Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, etc.).

To use this skill with the generic GSD SDK:
  1. Ensure the generic `gsd-sdk-gen` and `gsd-tools-gen` are on your PATH:
     export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/gsd-generic-all/bin"
  2. The SDK will auto-detect the .planning/ directory in your project root.
  3. All `gsd-sdk-gen query` and `gsd-tools-gen.cjs` calls in this skill work unchanged.

Original Codex-specific paths have been replaced with relative .planning/ paths.
