<objective>
Spike an idea through experiential exploration — build focused experiments to feel the pieces
of a future app, validate feasibility, and produce verified knowledge for the real build.
Spikes live in `.planning/spikes/` and integrate with GSD commit patterns, state tracking,
and handoff workflows.

Two modes:
- **Idea mode** (default) — describe an idea to spike
- **Frontier mode** (no argument or "frontier") — analyzes existing spike landscape and proposes integration and frontier spikes

Does not require `/gsd-new-project` — auto-creates `.planning/spikes/` if needed.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.planning/workflows/spike.md
@.planning/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`.
</runtime_note>

<context>
Idea: $ARGUMENTS

**Available flags:**
- `--quick` — Skip decomposition/alignment, jump straight to building. Use when you already know what to spike.
- `--text` — Use plain-text numbered lists instead of AskUserQuestion (for non-Codex runtimes).
</context>

<process>
Execute the spike workflow from @.planning/workflows/spike.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (prior spike check, decomposition, research, risk ordering, observability assessment, verification, MANIFEST updates, commit patterns).
</process>

<generic_adapter>
This is a GENERIC version of the GSD skill. It works with any AI runtime
(WorkBuddy, Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, etc.).

To use this skill with the generic GSD SDK:
  1. Ensure the generic `gsd-sdk-gen` and `gsd-tools-gen` are on your PATH:
     export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/gsd-generic-all/bin"
  2. The SDK will auto-detect the .planning/ directory in your project root.
  3. All `gsd-sdk-gen query` and `gsd-tools-gen.cjs` calls in this skill work unchanged.

Original Codex-specific paths have been replaced with relative .planning/ paths.
