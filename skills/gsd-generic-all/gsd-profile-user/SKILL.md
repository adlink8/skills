<objective>
Generate a developer behavioral profile from session analysis (or questionnaire) and produce artifacts (USER-PROFILE.md, /gsd-dev-preferences, AGENTS.md section) that personalize Codex's responses.

Routes to the profile-user workflow which orchestrates the full flow: consent gate, session analysis or questionnaire fallback, profile generation, result display, and artifact selection.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.planning/workflows/profile-user.md
@.planning/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Flags from $ARGUMENTS:
- `--questionnaire` -- Skip session analysis entirely, use questionnaire-only path
- `--refresh` -- Rebuild profile even when one exists, backup old profile, show dimension diff
</context>

<process>
Execute the profile-user workflow end-to-end.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Initialization and existing profile detection
2. Consent gate before session analysis
3. Session scanning and data sufficiency checks
4. Session analysis (profiler agent) or questionnaire fallback
5. Cross-project split resolution
6. Profile writing to USER-PROFILE.md
7. Result display with report card and highlights
8. Artifact selection (dev-preferences, AGENTS.md sections)
9. Sequential artifact generation
10. Summary with refresh diff (if applicable)
</process>

<generic_adapter>
This is a GENERIC version of the GSD skill. It works with any AI runtime
(WorkBuddy, Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, etc.).

To use this skill with the generic GSD SDK:
  1. Ensure the generic `gsd-sdk-gen` and `gsd-tools-gen` are on your PATH:
     export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/gsd-generic-all/bin"
  2. The SDK will auto-detect the .planning/ directory in your project root.
  3. All `gsd-sdk-gen query` and `gsd-tools-gen.cjs` calls in this skill work unchanged.

Original Codex-specific paths have been replaced with relative .planning/ paths.
