<objective>
Create a clean branch suitable for pull requests by filtering out .planning/ commits
from the current branch. Reviewers see only code changes, not GSD planning artifacts.

This solves the problem of PR diffs being cluttered with PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, STATE.md
changes that are irrelevant to code review.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.planning/workflows/pr-branch.md
</execution_context>

<process>
Execute the pr-branch workflow from @.planning/workflows/pr-branch.md end-to-end.
</process>

<generic_adapter>
This is a GENERIC version of the GSD skill. It works with any AI runtime
(WorkBuddy, Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, etc.).

To use this skill with the generic GSD SDK:
  1. Ensure the generic `gsd-sdk-gen` and `gsd-tools-gen` are on your PATH:
     export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/gsd-generic-all/bin"
  2. The SDK will auto-detect the .planning/ directory in your project root.
  3. All `gsd-sdk-gen query` and `gsd-tools-gen.cjs` calls in this skill work unchanged.

Original Codex-specific paths have been replaced with relative .planning/ paths.
