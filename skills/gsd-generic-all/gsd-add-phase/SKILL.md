<objective>
Add a new integer phase to the end of the current milestone in the roadmap.

Routes to the add-phase workflow which handles:
- Phase number calculation (next sequential integer)
- Directory creation with slug generation
- Roadmap structure updates
- STATE.md roadmap evolution tracking
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.planning/workflows/add-phase.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Arguments: $ARGUMENTS (phase description)

Roadmap and state are resolved in-workflow via `init phase-op` and targeted tool calls.
</context>

<process>
**Follow the add-phase workflow** from `@.planning/workflows/add-phase.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Argument parsing and validation
2. Roadmap existence checking
3. Current milestone identification
4. Next phase number calculation (ignoring decimals)
5. Slug generation from description
6. Phase directory creation
7. Roadmap entry insertion
8. STATE.md updates
</process>

<generic_adapter>
This is a GENERIC version of the GSD skill. It works with any AI runtime
(WorkBuddy, Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, etc.).

To use this skill with the generic GSD SDK:
  1. Ensure the generic `gsd-sdk-gen` and `gsd-tools-gen` are on your PATH:
     export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/gsd-generic-all/bin"
  2. The SDK will auto-detect the .planning/ directory in your project root.
  3. All `gsd-sdk-gen query` and `gsd-tools-gen.cjs` calls in this skill work unchanged.

Original Codex-specific paths have been replaced with relative .planning/ paths.
