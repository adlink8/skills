<generic_adapter>
This is a GENERIC version of the GSD skill. It works with any AI runtime
(WorkBuddy, Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, etc.).

To use this skill with the generic GSD SDK:
  1. Ensure the generic `gsd-sdk-gen` and `gsd-tools-gen` are on your PATH:
     export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/gsd-generic-all/bin"
  2. The SDK will auto-detect the .planning/ directory in your project root.
  3. All `gsd-sdk-gen query` and `gsd-tools-gen.cjs` calls in this skill work unchanged.

Original Codex-specific paths have been replaced with relative .planning/ paths.
